### Audience

### Description
The Tokenization Team is developing a prototype for a smart contract solution for the Value-Added-Tax (VAT) system in Switzerland. The objective of this prototype is to prevent VAT fraud, enhance system efficiency, transparency and security, and thus aid the government in ensuring their compliance and to safeguard revenue.
Similar to Ainsworth et al. (2016), the team proposed incorporating a VATToken (ERC20 Token) into their smart contracts solution for VAT payments. Moreover, a ReceiptToken (ERC721) can be generated after a successful VAT payment to the government, which provides an unfalsifiable proof of the transaction for both buyers and sellers of goods or services.

### Background
The need to change the VAT system arises from its inherent inefficiencies and susceptibility to fraud, as its all-phase taxation structure leads to complex calculations and creates opportunities for a range of fraudulent activities. Moreover, in Switzerland, common evasion methods like smuggling, undervaluation, and misuse of tax rates, as reported by the Bundesamt f√ºr Zoll und Grenzsicherheit (BAZG), highlight the persistent challenges in VAT administration, underscoring the urgency for systemic reform.

### Smart Contracts
#### [ReceiptTokenContract](VAT%20fraud/ReceiptTokenContract.sol)
- **Purpose**: The ReceiptTokenContract is an ERC721 contract and used to create blockchain-based receipts that can't be faked. These receipts can be used as a proof for the transaction including the VAT. Therefore the owner can show them to the tax authority aswell as take his good across the border.
- **Features**: [List the key features.]

#### [VATTokenContract](VAT%20fraud/VATTokenContract.sol)
- **Purpose**: The primary purpose of the VATTokenContract is an ERC20 Contract to digitize and manage the VAT process, bringing increased transparency, efficiency, and security to tax transactions. The VAT payment in this contract is also the basis to be able to create a ReceiptToken. This contract aims to simplify VAT payments and refunds, reduce the potential for fraud, and streamline tax administration. By leveraging blockchain technology, it offers an innovative solution to traditional VAT challenges, particularly in complex tax calculations including input tax deduction.
- **Features**:
