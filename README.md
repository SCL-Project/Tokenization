### Description
The Tokenization Team is developing a prototype for a smart contract solution for the Value-Added-Tax (VAT) system in Switzerland. The objective of this prototype is to prevent VAT fraud, enhance system efficiency, transparency and security, and thus aid the government in ensuring their compliance and to safeguard revenue.
Similar to Ainsworth et al. (2016), the team proposed incorporating a VATToken (ERC20 Token) into their smart contracts solution for VAT payments. Moreover, a ReceiptToken (ERC721) can be generated after a successful VAT payment to the government, which provides an unfalsifiable proof of the transaction for both buyers and sellers of goods or services.

### Background
The need to change the VAT system arises from its inherent inefficiencies and susceptibility to fraud, as its all-phase taxation structure leads to complex calculations and creates opportunities for a range of fraudulent activities. Moreover, in Switzerland, common evasion methods like smuggling, undervaluation, and misuse of tax rates, as reported by the Bundesamt f√ºr Zoll und Grenzsicherheit (BAZG), highlight the persistent challenges in VAT administration, underscoring the urgency for systemic reform.
