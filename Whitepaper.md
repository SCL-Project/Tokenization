# Enhancing Tax Compliance: Exploring the Potential of Smart Contracts regarding VAT Fraud

## Description
The Tokenization Team is developing a prototype for a smart contract solution for the Value-Added-Tax (VAT) system in Switzerland and the border to Germany. The objective of this prototype is to prevent VAT fraud, enhance system efficiency, transparency and security, and thus aid the government in ensuring their compliance and to safeguard revenue.
Similar to Ainsworth et al. (2016), the team proposed incorporating a VATToken (ERC20 Token) into their smart contracts solution for VAT payments. Moreover, a ReceiptToken (ERC721) can be generated after a successful VAT payment to the government, which provides an unfalsifiable proof of the transaction for both buyers and sellers of goods or services. In cross-border transactions, the CrossBorderContract is required to be able to transfer goods.

## Background
The need to change the VAT system arises from its inherent inefficiencies and susceptibility to fraud, as its all-phase taxation structure leads to complex calculations and creates opportunities for a range of fraudulent activities. Moreover, in Switzerland, common evasion methods like smuggling, undervaluation, and misuse of tax rates, as reported by the Bundesamt f√ºr Zoll und Grenzsicherheit (BAZG), highlight the persistent challenges in VAT administration, underscoring the urgency for systemic reform.

## Smart Contracts
### [ReceiptTokenContract](VAT%20Fraud/ReceiptTokenContract.sol)
- **Purpose**:
    The ReceiptTokenContract is an ERC721 contract integral to our blockchain-based VAT system, designed to tokenize buying and selling transactions. It aims to ensure transparent and immutable transaction records, significantly reducing VAT fraud potential. This contract is crucial in digitizing receipts and VAT records, ensuring each transaction is accurately and securely documented on the blockchain, including details about goods or services. It is invaluable for tracking and auditing, providing a reliable and efficient means of managing VAT-related information. It allows owners to present receipts to tax authorities and transport goods across borders transparently and legally.
- **Features**:
  - **Tokenization of Transactions**: Issues ERC721 tokens (NFTs) to represent individual transactions, ensuring a unique and tamper-proof record of each sale and purchase.
  - **Seller and Buyer Tokens**: Differentiates between tokens issued to sellers and buyers, encapsulating the details of each party's involvement in the transaction.
  - **Twin-Token ID**: The contract incorporates a unique twin-token ID mechanism to link the buyer and seller token.
  - **Receipt and Company Structs**: Defines structured data for receipt tokens and registered companies, encompassing essential transaction and entity details.
  - **VAT Calculation and Recording**: Calculates VAT based on transaction values and stores this information within each token, streamlining the tax recording process.
  - **Enhanced Transparency in Supply Chains**: Tracks and records the usage of products to produce further processed goods in supply chains, contributing to greater transparency and accountability.
  - **Secure Company Registration and Management**: Manages the registration of companies, ensuring that only authorized entities can create receipt tokens.
  - **Cross-Border Functionality**: Coordinates with the CrossBorderContract for international transactions, handling different VAT rates and regulations.
  - **VATToken Functionality**: Interacts with VATToken_DE and VATToken_CH for specific regional VAT handling, and integrates with an Oracle contract for dynamic VAT rate and currency information.
  - **Used Product Tracking**: Records the percentage of used products in further processed goods, aiding in VAT refund claims and supply chain management and transparency.
  - **Events for Token Creation and Chain End**: Emits events for new token creation and signaling the end of a supply chain, adding to the system's  traceability.

### [VATToken_CH](VAT%20Fraud/VATTokenContract.sol)
- **Purpose**:
    The primary purpose of the VATTokenContract is an ERC20 Contract to digitize and manage the VAT process, bringing increased transparency, efficiency, and security to tax transactions. The VAT payment in this contract is also the basis to be able to create a receipt token. This contract aims to simplify VAT payments and refunds, reduce the potential for fraud, and streamline tax administration. By leveraging blockchain technology, it offers an innovative solution to traditional VAT challenges, particularly in complex tax calculations including input tax deduction.
- **Features**:
  - **Tokenization of VAT**: The contract creates a digital representation of VAT credit given by the government after a fiat transaction is made, allowing for seamless and transparent tracking of VAT payments and obligations.
  - **ERC20 Compliance**: Adheres to the ERC20 standard, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of wallets and services in the Ethereum ecosystem.
  - **Tax Payment and Refund Mechanism**: Facilitates VAT payments from businesses to the government and manages tax refunds, ensuring accurate, fast and transparent transactions.

  - **Governmental Oversight**: Empowers government entities, such as tax authority, to mint, distribute, and manage VAT tokens, ensuring regulatory compliance.
  - **Transfer Restrictions**: Implements rules to prevent unauthorized or non-compliant transfer of tokens, reinforcing the integrity of the VAT process.
  - **Buy and Sell Functionality**: Enables businesses to buy VAT tokens against their token credit and sell them back to the government, facilitating liquidity in the VAT ecosystem.

### [CrossBorderContract](VAT%20Fraud/CrossBorderContract.sol)
- **Purpose**:
    The CrossBorderContract plays a crucial role in managing cross-border transactions within the VAT system. It is designed to automate and streamline the VAT adjustments for products and services that cross borders. The primary goal is to simplify the complex tax implications of cross-border commerce, ensuring compliance with different VAT rates and regulations. This contract is essential for reducing administrative burdens, mitigating VAT fraud, and fostering a more transparent international trade environment.
