# Starting the backend
Use ``node index.js`` in the p2p-backend folder to start the backend. It will also use port 3000 but react handles this by asking after running ``npm start``. Usually the react app will end up on port 3001


# change to Database login System
copy the code in the index.js file with the code from the databaseIndex.js file.
To connect the backend to the database you must have downloaded XAMPP and Apache and MySQL must be running and there must be a table called users in your p2p_lending Database.
