# Starting the backend
Open two terminals. 
For one navigate into the p2p-backend directory  ->  install npm (npm install) and all the dependencies (npm i ... )  ->  use ``node index.js`` to start the backend. It will run on port 4000
For the other navigate into the p2p-frontend-poc directory  ->  install npm (npm install) and all the dependencies (npm i ... )  ->  use ``npm start`` to run the frontend. It will run on port 3000 or 3001


# change to Database login System
copy the code in the index.js file with the code from the databaseIndex.js file.
To connect the backend to the database you must have downloaded XAMPP and Apache and MySQL must be running and there must be a table called users in your p2p_lending Database.

To run the application just start the backend as usual.
